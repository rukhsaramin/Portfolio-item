I have gained a lot of knowledge about writing code that is not only functional but also safe and testable as a result of working on these projects. As I build, I have come to understand how crucial it is to continuously test and confirm every aspect of the code. Writing unit tests in tandem with development particularly with JUnit allowed me to find mistakes early on, preventing more serious issues down the road. Additionally, it increased my confidence in my program's dependability.
In terms of user needs, I have discovered that creating software that works requires more than just writing code; it also entails creating code that addresses a genuine issue. I was better able to decide what features to include and how to organize my classes and services after I had a better understanding of the user's objectives and the environment in which they operate.
Software design now involves more planning than writing code. I now try to consider the classes I'll need, their respective roles, and their potential collaboration. Because I already had an idea of how my ContactService should work and be tested, writing it went much more smoothly.
